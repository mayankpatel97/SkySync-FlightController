## Introduction

This repository contains the hardware and software components of a Flight Controller based on the STM32 microcontroller. The Flight Controller is designed to provide stable flight control for quad and hex copters.

**Please note that this project is currently in development, and we welcome suggestions and contributions from the community to enhance its features and capabilities.**

## Hardware Components

- STM32 microcontroller board (provide details such as model and pin configuration)
- Sensors (e.g., IMU, GPS)
- Actuators (e.g., ESCs, motors)
- Power distribution board
- Frame and chassis
- Additional peripherals (e.g., telemetry module, radio receiver)

## Software Components

- Firmware for the STM32 microcontroller
- Ground Control Station (GCS) software
- Simulation and testing tools (if applicable)

## Features

- []
